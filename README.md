When a city is searched, today's weather including temperature, wind speed, humidity level, and uv index plus the 5 day forecast with the same features displayed. 

After a city is searched, it gets displayed underneath the search bar. 

## Points of Interest

### Search Bar
The features that stand out to me is that when I type in an input into the city input box, I successfully grab that value and get all of the relevant information using multiple API pulls both in the current forecast and future forecast. 

### Current Weather
After searching for the appropriate city in the search, the corresponding current and future weather shows up on the page. When displaying the current weather information, the UV Index box turns green if the UV Index is below 4, turns yellow if between 4 and 8, and turns red if above 8. 

### 5 Day Forecast
Along with the current weather information, the future 5 day forecast shows up to display the date, temperature, windspeed, and humidity for each day. 

## Successes

I felt successful in pulling API's and successfully displaying multiple features on the same page. 

## Challenges

I struggled with adding the icons, even though I successfully pulled the correct icon tag. I also, struggled with getting past displays to display on the page. I have the correct event target listener applied so when the button is clicked, the correct city search comes up. I wasn't able to properly get the remaining currenta and future information to display.
