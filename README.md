When a city is searched, today's weather including temperature, wind speed, humidity level, and uv index plus the 5 day forecast with the same features displayed. 

After a city is searched, it gets displayed underneath the search bar. 

## Features

The features that stand out to me is that when I type in an input into the city input box, I successfully grab that value and get all of the relevant information using multiple API pulls both in the current forecast and future forecast. 

## Successes

I felt successful in pulling API's and successfully displaying multiple features on the same page.

## Challenges

I struggled with adding the icons, even though I successfully pulled the correct icon tag. I also, struggled with getting past displays to display on the page. I have the correct information in my console.log but not sure where to get the new information to display on the page.
